In function 'highest_product_short_version', time complexity is O(nlogn) because of the sorting algorithm. Space complexity is O(1).
In function 'highest_product_optimized', we are sorting lists with 2 and 3 elements, so time complexity depends only on the number of elements in the 'numbers' list when we iterate over it, so O(n). Space complexity is O(2) which becomes O(1).
